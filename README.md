## Welcome to my personal and professional website.

I am a Mathematics PhD student in the [Ruhr-Uni-Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/index.html.de). My research is mainly in the intersection between Dynamical Systems and Symplectic Geometry.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/elbechu/elbechu.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
